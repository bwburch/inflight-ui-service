-- Migration: Recreate configuration change types tables (rollback)
-- Description: This rollback is intentionally empty as we don't want to restore these tables
--              If you need to rollback, manually restore from backup

-- This migration cannot be easily reversed as the data model has changed
-- If you need to rollback, restore from database backup
